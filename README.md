# SIM7000
Working Botletics SIM7000A shield on Arduino Uno with Verizon to Adafruit IO.

Code had to be shortened considerably (especially the embedded status strings) to enable use on Arduino Uno.

Currently using a standard activated Verizon 4G/LTE sim card out of an iPhone 6S.

Note: While doing testing I was unable to succesfully send a text or make a call.  I think Verizon may not be allowing the
SIM7000 on the voice/sms part of the network.  Internet access is working.
