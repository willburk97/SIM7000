# SIM7000
Working Botletics (https://github.com/botletics) SIM7000A shield on Arduino Uno with Verizon to Adafruit IO.

Code had to be shortened considerably (especially the embedded status strings) to enable use on Arduino Uno.

Currently using a standard activated Verizon 4G/LTE sim card out of an iPhone 6S.

Note: While doing initial testing I was unable to succesfully send a text or make a call.  I think Verizon may not be allowing the
SIM7000A on the voice/sms part of the network.  Internet access is working.
